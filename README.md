# RainCheck
A weather checking application based on Flutter. Written in VSCode using Dart
Utilises the OpenWeatherMaps API for reporting the weather and the FontAwesome icons for the weather icons

## Features:
- Day/Night cycle for background
- Changing icons dependent on weather
- Brief, informative overview of the current weather in your area
- Works across web/android seamlessly
- Sleek, minimalistic design elements

*(Note: GPS was set manually, hence the differences in reported locations in the screenshot)*

## To Run:
Currently no executable has been provided, and an API key for OpenWeatherMaps must be provided inside of /lib/credentials/
Mine is currently left as there is no billing info, and I'm *just not really bothered* at this point in time

## To-Do:
- Add a daytime background, the code exists just currently runs the normal
  - Adding a timezone based switch for this instead of static time
- Adding more icons for different conditions
- Updating the spash screen design and function
- Neaten up the UI builder
- Update main interface with more design elements, functionality and aesthetic
